I'm going to speedrun this but keep it basic enough, let's start:

You abviously know of the basic symbols and they make up the majority of them, they are

- Curved Brackets   ( )

- Curly Brackets    { }

- Double Quotes     " "

- Square Brackets   [ ]

- Semi-colon         :

Easy enough and if anything you might not deviate from them for the most part in any form of code


Now to print things it's obviously "print" however in Java it's a little more different as it has
"Systen.out" on it, complete it looks like so

System.out.print{};

and before the question arises, yes, the "S" will always have to be capatalized, it's the only way
the computer will understand the command.

funny enough, to print out, you don't need the Double Quotes in the print function.
