I'm going to speedrun this but keep it basic enough, let's start:

First thing is the Compiler we'll use to code, there are a few out there but for this, we'll be
using Eclipse IDE

- https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

You abviously know of the basic symbols and they make up the majority of code in general, they are

- Curved Brackets   ( )     | Used for built-in functions

- Curly Brackets    { }     | Used for functions we make, for example "main" or "inventory", I'll
                              cover this later

- Double Quotes     " "     | Used for "string" type variables and built-in functions

- Square Brackets   [ ]     | Used for "Arrays"

- Semi-colon         :      | NEVER FORGET IT AT THE END OF YOUR CODE LINE, aka, the cause of many
                              programming headaches/most important thing in code

Easy enough and if anything you might not deviate from them for the most part in any form of code


Now to print things it's obviously "print" however in Java it's a little more different as it has
"Systen.out" on it, complete it looks like so

System.out.print{};

And before the question arises, yes, the "S" will always have to be capatalized, it's the only way
the computer will understand the command.

Another thing to know is how to "comment", quite simply it's just double slashes

- Double Slashes    //      | Used to, well, Comment, this does not add anything to the code, it's
                                ignored by the compiler

These are just a few things I will cover here since it's something all programmers should know, and 
why not start with a basic form of how to use it than with throwing one in. After this note things 
will get a little loaded, but just take it slow and you'll get through it, I'll try to keep it low 
but informative, like this one.

You can see this all in the "basics.java" file 
[path: JavaCodeThings\`1_JavaNotes\JavaCode\src\main\java] if using eclipse for it all, it's under src
